#Number 13 (Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.)

#input for base and height
base = int(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = int(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

#area of triangle formula
area = 1 / 2 * base * height

#output
print(f"Area of the triangle: {area}")
